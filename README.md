# BlazeDemo Website Automation Testing

This repository contains an automation framework built with **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **TestNG** to perform end-to-end testing on the **BlazeDemo** flight reservation website.

### ðŸ§ª **Test Cases Automated**
This project automates the following test scenarios:

1. **Dropdown Selections**: Test the flight selection dropdowns (From/To Cities).
2. **Flight Search**: Validate that the search results page appears after a successful search.
3. **Booking Flow**: Verify the booking flow with passenger details and confirm the booking.
4. **Page Validations**: Assert that the correct page elements (flight results, error messages) are present.
5. **Negative Testing**: Test invalid input and handle error scenarios gracefully.
6. **Cross-Scenario Testing**: Validate the system for multiple combinations of departure and destination cities (14 tests in total).

### ðŸš€ **Tech Stack**
- **Java**: Programming language
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Browser automation tool
- **TestNG**: Test framework for assertions and reporting
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern used to structure the framework

### ðŸŽ¯ **Project Features**
- **TestNG Reporting**: View test results in HTML/XML formats.
- **Reusable Components**: Page Object Model to keep test scripts organized and easy to maintain.
- **Automated Execution**: Running the entire test suite automatically with just one command.
